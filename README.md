# README - How this repository has been created

## Introduction

This GitHub repository has been created by Oliveira Da Silva Patrick (020152332A).

This link has been used to learn markdown: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/

I prefer using the GitHub Desktop app. The screenshot provided were taken on that same app.
Alternatively, you can create the repository with the browser version of GitHub but the file
upload is limited. Visual Studio Code is also really useful as commiting and publishing code
can be done through the same editor.

## Tutorial

1. Open the app and click on 'Create a New Repository on your Hard Drive...'.
   ![Create repository](./images/01-create-repo.png)
2. test
